# Project Streamlining Plan (MVP Focus)

This document outlines the plan to streamline the codebase for a performant, focused v1.0 MVP, emphasizing a robust project structure and development workflow.

1.  **Project Setup & Analysis (Completed)**
    *   Generated `llms.txt` to get a full codebase overview.
    *   Analyzed `llms.txt` and the general project structure to identify areas for streamlining. The existing structure is largely modern and sound, so streamlining focuses on minor corrections, TODOs, and ensuring robustness.

2.  **Refine Test Implementation (Completed)**
    *   **Action:** Corrected the `test_add` function in `tests/test_main.py`.
        *   The function was previously not using its parametrized inputs (`a`, `b`, `expected_sum`) in assertions, leading to redundant and incomplete testing.
        *   Modified to use `assert add(a, b) == expected_sum`.
    *   **Note:** Verification by running `hatch run test` was persistently blocked by a `TOMLDecodeError` in `pyproject.toml`. The test code modification itself is complete.
    *   **Side-effect:** Added `hatch-vcs` to `[tool.hatch.envs.default.dependencies]` in `pyproject.toml` during attempts to resolve test environment issues. This is a correct addition for projects using dynamic versioning with `hatch-vcs`.

3.  **Update Configuration Files (Completed)**
    *   **`pyproject.toml`:**
        *   Replaced placeholder URLs in `[project.urls]` (e.g., "https://github.com/your-username/my_package") with generic placeholders ("https://github.com/example-org/example-repo").
        *   The `[tool.hatch.envs.uv]` section was reviewed and kept as it's illustrative, though `uv` integration is primarily via Hatch's global config or `HATCH_UV=1`.
        *   Corrected a typo: `skip-magic-trailing_comma` to `skip-magic-trailing-comma` in `[tool.ruff.format]`.
    *   **`.pre-commit-config.yaml`:** No changes deemed necessary; configuration appears solid.
    *   **`.github/workflows/main.yml`:** No changes deemed necessary; CI workflow is modern and uses Hatch effectively.
    *   **Note:** The `TOMLDecodeError` also impacts full verification of `pyproject.toml` functionality, but its static content has been updated as planned.

4.  **Update Documentation (Completed)**
    *   **`README.md`:**
        *   Replaced placeholder clone URL (`https://github.com/your-username/my_package.git`) with a generic version (`https://github.com/example-org/example-repo.git`).
    *   **`CONTRIBUTING.md`:**
        *   Replaced placeholder clone URL with a generic one for user forks (`https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/example-repo.git`).
        *   Rephrased the "TODO" note regarding the Code of Conduct to be a suggestion for adopters of the template.

5.  **Create Planning and Tracking Documents (Current)**
    *   Create `PLAN.md` (this file).
    *   Create `TODO.md` with a markdown checklist based on this plan.
    *   Create and initialize `CHANGELOG.md`, then update with progress from steps 2-4.

6.  **Implement Changes & Document Progress (Ongoing)**
    *   This is a meta-step. Changes for steps 2-4 have been implemented. Documentation (changelog, TODO) is being updated in step 5.

7.  **Review and Finalize**
    *   Review all changes made to code, configuration, and documentation to ensure they align with the MVP goals (a performant, focused, robust project structure).
    *   Ensure all documentation files (`README.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `PLAN.md`, `TODO.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`) are consistent and up-to-date.
    *   Attempt to run all quality checks: `hatch run lint:style` and `hatch run test`.
        *   **Blocker:** This is contingent on resolving the persistent `TOMLDecodeError` in `pyproject.toml`. If the error remains, this step cannot be fully completed.

8.  **Submit Changes**
    *   Commit all changes with a descriptive commit message.
    *   Use an appropriate branch name (e.g., `feature/streamline-mvp`).

**Persistent Issue:**
*   A `TOMLDecodeError` occurs when `hatch` (specifically Python's `tomllib`) tries to parse `pyproject.toml`. The error has pointed to various lines within/near the `[tool.hatch.envs.lint]` section. Multiple attempts to fix this (including rewriting the section, quoting keys, and fully overwriting `pyproject.toml` with a presumed-good version from `llms.txt`) have not resolved the error in the sandbox environment. This prevents running tests and linters via `hatch` commands. The static file contents are believed to be correct.Tool output for `create_file_with_block`:
